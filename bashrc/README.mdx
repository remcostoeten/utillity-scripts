# Shell Configuration Setup

This is my personal (WiP) modular and scalable setup for managing my entire shell setup, including aliases and functions.

> [!NOTE]
> Directory paths, logic and nameing is WiP hence the folder `TODO_RESTRUCTURE_FROM_HERE`.

## Directory Structure

The configuration file, for me `.bashrc` but could also be `.zshrc` which should be located in the root of the user's home directory. `cat ~/.bashrc` where `~` is the user's home directory.

You should maintain a directory on your system where all your shell configuration files are stored. In my case, this directory is currently located at `~/development/utility-scripts/bashrc/TODO_RESTRUCTURE_FROM_HERE/`. However, a best practice would be to place it within your development directory, like this: `~/development/shell-configuration`, or you could keep it alongside the configuration file, such as `~/shell-configuration`.


```python
TODO_RESTRUCTURE_FROM_HERE/
│
├── inject_all.sh               # Central script that sources all other injectors
│
├── injectors/
│   ├── alias_injector.bash     # Sources all alias files
│   └── function_injector.bash  # Sources all function files
│
├── functions/                  # Directory containing individual function scripts
│   ├── catcopy_function.bash
│   ├── colorize_logs.bash
│   ├── copypwd_function.bash
│   ├── countdown-timer.bash
│   ├── dir_size_calculator.bash
│   └── move_except.bash
│
├── aliases/                    # Directory containing individual alias scripts
│   ├── development_aliases.bash
│   ├── general_aliases.bash
│   ├── git_aliases.bash
│   └── navigation_aliases.bash
│
└── logs/
    └── log.log                 # Example log file for testing
```

## Flow / architecture

> [!TIP]
> I opted for .bashrc and singular .bash partials, but exactly the same applies for .zshrc or .sh partials as they are backward compatible and thus interchangeable.

### 1. **inject_all.sh**

This is the central script that sources both the`alias_injector.bash! and`function_injector.bash! scripts. By sourcing this file in your`.bashrc! or`.zshrc!, you ensure that all your aliases and functions are loaded in every new shell session.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Source the Inject All Script
source /path/to/TODO_RESTRUCTURE_FROM_HERE/inject_all.sh
```

### 2. **alias_injector.bash**

This script sources all alias files stored in the`aliasses/! directory. Each alias file is categorized by its purpose, making it easy to manage and extend.

**Example:**

```bash
# Source the Alias Injector
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/aliasses/general_aliasses.bash"
```

### 3. **function_injector.bash**

This script sources all function files stored in the`functions/! directory. Each function is modular and can be easily added or removed as needed.

**Example:**

```bash
# Source the Function Injector
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/functions/catcopy_function.bash"
```

## Expanding and Scaling the Setup

### Adding New Aliases

1. **Create a New Alias File**: Add a new`.bash! file in the`aliasses/! directory with your desired aliases.
2. **Source the Alias File**: Update`alias_injector.bash! to include your new alias file.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   # Source New Alias File
   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/aliasses/my_new_aliases.bash"
   ```

### Adding New Functions

1. **Create a New Function File**: Add a new`.bash! file in the`functions/! directory with your new function.
2. **Source the Function File**: Update`function_injector.bash! to include your new function file.

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   # Source New Function File
   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/functions/my_new_function.bash"
   ```

### Scaling the Setup

As your setup grows, consider organizing aliases and functions into more specific categories. You can create subdirectories within`aliasses/! or`functions/! if necessary, and adjust the injector scripts to source files from these new locations.

This setup ensures a clean and organized shell environment, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance. Feel free to customize and extend it according to your needs.
